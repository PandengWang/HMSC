\itemize{
    \item{\code{Y}}{ A community \code{matrix} including 60 bryophytes species sampled at 204 sites}
    \item{\code{X}}{ A \code{matrix} of 5 covariates (intercept + 4 covariates describing the size of the logs on which bryophytes were sampled and the type of forests)}

\description{
Epiphytic bryophytes growing on aspen trees in central Finland
}
\details{
This data was first introduced by Olden et al. (2014) and reanalyzed by Ovaskainen et al. (submitted). In all, 60 bryophyte species were sampled at 204 sites in 14 natural and 14 harvested forests in central Finland.

\note{
In this data, the covariates (\code{X}) have not been scaled. Because some of the analyses in the manual require that the covariates be scaled, use the following code to perform the analysis.

\code{data(bryophytes)}

\code{bryophyteNoScaleX <- bryophytes}

\code{bryophytes <- as.HMSCdata(Y=bryophytes$Y, X = bryophytes$X, Tr = bryophytes$Tr,
                                Phylo = bryophytes$Phylo, Random = bryophytes$Random,
                                scaleX = TRUE, scaleTr = FALSE,
                                interceptX = FALSE, interceptTr = FALSE)}
