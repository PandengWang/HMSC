\title{Variation partitioning}
\usage{
variPart(hmsc, groupX)
}
\arguments{
\item{hmsc}{An object of the class \code{hmsc}.}

\item{groupX}{A vector defining how the covariates (\code{X}) are grouped. This argument is ignored if the models does not have any covariates.}
}
\value{
A list presenting how the explained variation in the data is partitioned between the different groups of the covariates (first part of thet list) and the random effects (second part of the list). Note that both autocorrelated (\code{Auto}) and non-autocorrelated (\code{Random}) are considered here. In addition, this function also calculate the amount of variation explained by traits.
}
\description{
Partition the variation of models
}
\details{
When deciding how to group the covariates using \code{groupX}, it is essential to also account for the intercept (if present). If it is not included, an error message will be sent. If it is not clear in which group the intercept need to be considered, it is a good idea to include it in a seperate group.

\examples{

#================
### Generate data
#================
desc <- cbind(scale(1:50), scale(1:50)^2)
nspecies <- 20
commDesc <- communitySimul(X = desc, nsp = nspecies)

#=============
### Formatting
#=============
### Format data
formdata <- as.HMSCdata(Y = commDesc$data$Y, X = desc, interceptX = FALSE,  interceptTr = FALSE)

#==============
### Build model
#==============
modelDesc <- hmsc(formdata, niter = 2000, nburn = 1000, thin = 1, verbose = 100)

#==================================
### Calculate variance partitioning
#==================================
vp <- variPart(modelDesc, groupX = c("A", "B"))
vp

#===================
### Plot the results
#===================
barplot(t(vp), las = 2)
